# How to Downgrade Paperwhite 1 5.6.1.1 to 5.3.3

  
- Download earlier update file from Amazon: Kindle Paperwhite 1 Update 5.3.3 [https://s3.amazonaws.com/G7G_Firmwar...ndle_5.3.3.bin](https://s3.amazonaws.com/G7G_FirmwareUpdates_WebDownloads/update_kindle_5.3.3.bin)  

- Disable wifi on your Paperwhite 1 (airplane mode).  

- Connect your Kindle Paperwhite 1 to your computer (DO NOT DISCONNECT UNTIL LAST STEP!).  

- Copy the bin file you downloaded in step 1 to root folder of PW1.  

- Wait at least 2 minutes after copy has completed.  

- Push and hold power button until your PW1 restarts (the led blinks orange and light turns on at the screen). 

- Wait until the PW1 has installed the upgrade (really a downgrade).  

- Now you can DISCONNECT from your computer.
