# Jailbreak-pw

Download the **K5 JailBreak** package from the [Snapshots](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030) thread, and unpack it. In here, you'll find a few files.  

Unzip the **contents** of the **kindle-5.4-jailbreak.zip** archive to the root directory of your Kindle.  

  

Now, eject & unplug your Kindle, and go to **HOME -> MENU > Settings -> MENU > Update Your Kindle**. 

The updater won't actually ever run, this is **normal**. After a few seconds, the words ****** JAILBREAK ****** will appear at the bottom of your screen to confirm that the device is jailbroken ![[a0e3b04c2c747c2355d12d8a70f3bccb_MD5.gif|"Wink"]]. You won't see this message again, it's simply a confirmation message.  

  

And that's it, your Kindle is now ready to install custom hacks!  

  
**Since v1.11.N:** If you need to use something [MKK](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=233932)-powered *immediately*, be aware that MKK will only be active on the **next** boot. Installing another package through the Update mechanism will do the trick, or you can manually trigger a device restart (*[HOME] -> [MENU] > Settings -> [MENU] > Restart*).
